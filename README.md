This project is no longer supported
-----------------------------------

We have transitioned over to a containerized setup in order to better keep our production and development work in sync. 

Please see the [`kobo-install` installation steps for more details](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kobo-install). Linux and OS X are supported. Docker for Windows is not supported at this time; however, you may run `kobo-install` on Windows using a virtual machine (e.g. VirtualBox).


Vagrant Installation of Kobo Development Box
============================================

1. ensure you have [virtualbox](http://virtualbox.org) and [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) installed

1. In the "dist-kobo-devel" project, run `vagrant up`

1. Wait (this process will take a long time, 30 mins+ depending on network connection)

1. Open your browser to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and log in with the credentials username `kobo` and password `kobo`.

1. You can now run these commands from within this directory

 * `vagrant ssh` # ssh into the virtual machine
 * `vagrant reload --provision` # reload the provision script after pulling the latest code

How to load from an existing .box file
--------------------------------------
